					<h3>SQL</h3>
						<p>Prior to my internship at Fannie Mae, I had limited experience in SQL. However, through numerous hours of self-study with sites such as sqlzoo.com, and mobile apps like Knowledify SQL, I have become proficient in SQL. Currently at Fannie Mae, I am using my knowledge of SQL to integrate loan records into Fannie's Enterprise Data Warehouse. I am creating tables, writing queries, and various other tasks to ensure everything is being done correctly.</p>
						
					<h3>Computer Networking</h3>
						<p>Before my interest in coding began to develop, what got my interested in IT was networking. While I was in high school, I took a three month course for the CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate) certification with JMAT Systems. I excelled for the several months, but did go on to take my certification test. However, the knowledge I gained from the experience stayed with me as I transitioned into Year Up.</p>
						
						<p>At Year Up, I demonstrated my networking knowledge by leading my class during an  in-class group project. We had to set up our computer lab of 20 desktop computers from scratch, monitors, cables, tables, and all. Although our initial approach to to the challenge was not successful, I took the  initiative to create a step-by-step guide that assigned roles for everyone to increase efficiency. As a result, my class had the best time (about 45 minutes).</p>
