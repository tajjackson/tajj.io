					<h3>HTML Group Project</h3>
						<p>This was the project that initiated my interest in coding. I learned what it was like to have to troubleshoot when things wouldn't go my way, fix the problems, and do it all over again. Prior to the project, I never thought that I would be the that guy sitting in a dark room, typing furiously in frustration trying to figure out why my website won't load. However, I found that after all the frustration, there is a great sense of accomplishment when you have a finished product.</p>
						
						<p>Several classmates and I created a website comparing different Operating Systems. The criteria for creating the website was very straightforward. We had to create three web pages, and incorporate basic tags like "br", "h1", etc. I had learned these basics already, and I was willing to do more. So our group decided to exceed expectations in several ways. For instance, we implemented more than just HTML by incorporating CSS (with no previous instruction), and also did several more web pages than required (six), all within a two week period. As a result, we earned a 95% on the project.

					<h3>Bathe Poirot</h3>
						<p>Bathe Poriot (BP), an art trading and architecture company, requested for a website to be developed to sell their art work, and later display their architectural solutions. Three students out of seventeen were selected to be Project Managers (PMs), and the PMs formed their teams with the remainder of students.</p>
						
						<p>As Lead Web Developer for my team, I managed the front and back-end development using the content management system (CMS) Joomla. We created a virtual gallery, incorporated a PayPal payment option, and several other features. Compared to my first small project, this project definitely raised the bar for effort required.<p>
						
						<p>In addition to creating a website for the stakeholder (BP), we also needed to create a proposal. This was where most of our team's time was spent. Since I am normally used to jumping right into development, it was a challenge for me to do the more tedious work that comes with developing a product. As a result, I learned the value of patience and persistence.</p>
